## Thus far this language generates C code to execute its program
<br>

<div style="text-align: center">
This is a simple programming language. <br>
So, my wife wants to start learning programming. <br>
And I decided to create a programming language for her. <br>
Therefore, this project can be modified if my wife wants to change the programming language :) <br>
</div>

## Example
```kotlin
fun foo(x, y) {
    x + y;
}
```
